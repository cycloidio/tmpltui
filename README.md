# tmpltui 

This is a small TUI to pick a template file and render it, the original file and the rendered result are shown side by side.

The `data.json` file contains the data that is used to render the template.

You can change the template delimiters by specifying in `data.json` a `left_delimiter` and a `right_delimiter` string.


## Example

A simple example configuration is in `example_cycloid.yaml`, you can change the data in `data.json` and see how the rendering changes.
